# Codejnki Utility MongoRepository

This code was originally based off of [https://github.com/alexandre-spieser/mongodb-generic-repository](https://github.com/alexandre-spieser/mongodb-generic-repository).

Been reworking it over time to fit my programming styles.

There is an autofac module `MongoRepositoryModule` that you can add to you dependency injection.

Create a class that implements `IMongoDbConfig` and it should just work :)
